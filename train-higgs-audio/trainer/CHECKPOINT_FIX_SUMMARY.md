# Checkpoint Saving Fix Summary

## Problem
The training script was failing with the error:
```
TypeError: Trainer._save_checkpoint() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given
```

This occurred when the training process tried to save a checkpoint during training.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the custom [_save_checkpoint](file:///[app]/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/trainer.py#L2371-L2413) method in the [HiggsAudioTrainer](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2_ddp.py#L590-L618) class in train_v2_ddp.py. The method was attempting to call the parent class's [_save_checkpoint](file:///[app]/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/trainer.py#L2371-L2413) method but was passing the wrong number of arguments.

The previous implementation used `inspect.signature()` to check if the 'metrics' parameter was available, but this approach was not working correctly.

## Solution
We replaced the `inspect.signature()` approach with a simple try-except block:

```python
def _save_checkpoint(self, model, trial, metrics=None):
    """Custom checkpoint saving for LoRA training"""
    # Call the parent method with the correct arguments
    try:
        # Try calling with metrics parameter first
        super()._save_checkpoint(model, trial, metrics)
    except TypeError:
        # If that fails, call without metrics
        super()._save_checkpoint(model, trial)
    
    # Rest of the method for LoRA adapter saving...
```

This approach:
1. First tries to call the parent method with all three arguments (model, trial, metrics)
2. If that fails with a TypeError (indicating wrong number of arguments), it falls back to calling with just two arguments (model, trial)
3. This handles both possible signatures of the parent method without needing to inspect it

## Files Modified
- `/Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2_ddp.py` - Fixed the [_save_checkpoint](file:///[app]/venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages/transformers/trainer.py#L2371-L2413) method in the [HiggsAudioTrainer](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2_ddp.py#L590-L618) class

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and should resolve the TypeError during checkpoint saving. The training process should now be able to save checkpoints correctly during training, including saving LoRA adapters separately when using LoRA training.
