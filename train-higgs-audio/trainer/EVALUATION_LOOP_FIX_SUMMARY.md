# Evaluation Loop Fix Summary

## Problem
The trainer.py and trainer_ddp.py scripts were missing proper evaluation loop implementations that ensure the `eval_loss` metric is computed and returned when using `metric_for_best_model="eval_loss"`. This could lead to KeyError exceptions during checkpoint saving when trying to access the eval_loss metric.

## Root Cause
1. **train_v2_ddp.py** had both a custom [evaluation_loop](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2.py#L699-L716) method and a [compute_metrics](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2_ddp.py#L781-L793) function that properly handled the `eval_loss` metric
2. **trainer_ddp.py** and **trainer.py** were missing these implementations
3. When `metric_for_best_model="eval_loss"` is used, the Trainer expects the evaluation loop to return this metric in the metrics dictionary

## Solution
Added custom [evaluation_loop](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2.py#L699-L716) methods to both trainer.py and trainer_ddp.py that:

1. Force `prediction_loss_only=False` to ensure loss is computed during evaluation
2. Call the parent evaluation loop to get the standard evaluation results
3. Explicitly ensure that `eval_loss` is included in the metrics dictionary
4. Return the updated evaluation results

## Files Modified

### 1. trainer_ddp.py
- Added custom [evaluation_loop](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2.py#L699-L716) method to the [HiggsAudioTrainer](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/trainer_ddp.py#L605-L624) class
- The method ensures `eval_loss` is computed and included in the metrics dictionary

### 2. trainer.py
- Added custom [evaluation_loop](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/train_v2.py#L699-L716) method to the [HiggsAudioTrainer](file:///Users/vikram.solanki/Projects/exp/level1/speech_synth/train-higgs-audio/trainer/trainer.py#L603-L624) class
- The method ensures `eval_loss` is computed and included in the metrics dictionary

## Implementation Details

### Custom Evaluation Loop
```python
def evaluation_loop(self, dataloader, description, prediction_loss_only=None, ignore_keys=None, metric_key_prefix="eval"):
    """
    Custom evaluation loop that ensures eval_loss is computed and returned
    """
    # Force prediction_loss_only to False to ensure loss is computed
    if prediction_loss_only is None:
        prediction_loss_only = False
        
    # Call the parent evaluation loop
    eval_result = super().evaluation_loop(
        dataloader, description, prediction_loss_only, ignore_keys, metric_key_prefix
    )
    
    # Ensure eval_loss is in the metrics
    if "eval_loss" not in eval_result.metrics and hasattr(eval_result, 'loss'):
        eval_result.metrics["eval_loss"] = eval_result.loss
        
    return eval_result
```

## Benefits
1. **Consistency**: All training scripts now have consistent evaluation loop implementations
2. **Reliability**: Prevents KeyError exceptions when using `metric_for_best_model="eval_loss"`
3. **Compatibility**: Works with the existing `--disable_evaluation` flag implementation
4. **Backward Compatible**: Doesn't change the behavior when evaluation is disabled

## Testing
The fix has been implemented and should resolve issues with evaluation metrics handling in trainer.py and trainer_ddp.py scripts. The implementation follows the same pattern as the working train_v2_ddp.py script.
