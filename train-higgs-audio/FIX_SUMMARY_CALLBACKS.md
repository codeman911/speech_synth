# Strategic Logging Callbacks Fix Summary

## Issue Identified

The strategic logging callbacks were not receiving the model inputs and outputs they needed to provide detailed analysis of the training process. This was happening because:

1. The callbacks were using the `on_log` method which is primarily for logging metrics, not for accessing model data
2. The Hugging Face Trainer does not automatically pass model inputs and outputs to the `on_log` callback
3. The trainer was not overridden to pass this data to the callbacks

Additionally, there was a signature mismatch in the `training_step` method that caused a runtime error:
- Hugging Face Trainer calls `training_step` with 4 arguments: (self, model, inputs, num_items_in_batch)
- Our override only accepted 3 arguments: (self, model, inputs)

## Root Cause

The fundamental issue was a misunderstanding of how Hugging Face Trainer callbacks work. The `on_log` method is called for logging metrics, but model inputs and outputs are not automatically passed to it. To access this data, we needed to:

1. Override the `training_step` method in the custom trainer
2. Change the callbacks to use `on_step_end` instead of `on_log`
3. Manually pass the model inputs, outputs, and model to the callbacks

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated HiggsAudioTrainer (`trainer/train_v2_ddp.py`)

Fixed the `training_step` method signature to match the Hugging Face Trainer interface:
- Added `num_items_in_batch=None` parameter to match expected signature
- Added a custom `training_step` method that:
  - Calls the parent training step to get loss and outputs
  - Manually passes inputs, outputs, and model to callbacks via `on_step_end`
  - Uses the callback handler to call the event with the required data

### 2. Updated Strategic Logging Callbacks (`callbacks/strategic_logging.py`)

Changed all four callbacks from using `on_log` to `on_step_end`:
- `InputLoggerCallback` - Now receives inputs and can analyze model inputs
- `OutputLoggerCallback` - Now receives outputs and can analyze model predictions
- `SharedAttentionLoggerCallback` - Now receives the model and can analyze structure
- `ZeroShotVerificationLoggerCallback` - Now receives inputs and model for verification

Updated the method signatures to properly handle:
- `inputs=None` - Model inputs from the training step
- `outputs=None` - Model outputs from the training step  
- `model=None` - The model being trained

### 3. Enhanced Debugging Information

Added comprehensive debugging output at step 1 to show what data is being received by each callback, making it easier to verify the fix is working.

## Verification

The fix has been validated through syntax checking and structural analysis:
- ✅ All files pass syntax validation
- ✅ Callbacks now use `on_step_end` method
- ✅ Trainer properly overrides `training_step` with correct signature
- ✅ Required parameters are present in callback methods

## Expected Behavior

With this fix, the strategic logging should now work as intended:

1. At step 1: Detailed debugging information showing what data is received
2. Every N steps (configurable): Detailed analysis of model inputs, outputs, and performance
3. Proper access to audio features, logits, and other model data for zero-shot voice cloning verification

## Files Modified

1. `trainer/train_v2_ddp.py` - Added `training_step` override with correct signature
2. `callbacks/strategic_logging.py` - Changed all callbacks from `on_log` to `on_step_end`
3. Created validation scripts to verify the fix

This fix should resolve the "Logits: NOT FOUND", "Whisper Embedding Status: ❌ DISABLED or NOT FOUND", and "Input IDs: ❌ NOT FOUND" issues that were appearing in the logs, as well as the TypeError about the training_step method signature.
