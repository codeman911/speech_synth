# Strategic Logging Fix for Zero-Shot Voice Cloning

## Problem Summary

The strategic logging callbacks were not receiving the model inputs and outputs needed to provide detailed analysis of the training process. This resulted in logs showing "Logits: NOT FOUND", "Whisper Embedding Status: ❌ DISABLED or NOT FOUND", and "Input IDs: ❌ NOT FOUND".

Additionally, there were runtime errors:
1. `TypeError: HiggsAudioTrainer.training_step() takes 3 positional arguments but 4 were given`
2. `TypeError: transformers.trainer_callback.DefaultFlowCallback.on_step_end() got multiple values for keyword argument 'model'`

## Root Cause

The issues were caused by:

1. **Wrong Callback Method**: The callbacks were using `on_log` which is primarily for logging metrics, not for accessing model data
2. **No Data Passing**: Hugging Face Trainer does not automatically pass model inputs and outputs to callbacks
3. **Missing Override**: The trainer was not overridden to manually pass this data to the callbacks
4. **Signature Mismatch**: The `training_step` method signature didn't match the Hugging Face Trainer interface
5. **Parameter Conflicts**: Passing the model as a keyword argument caused conflicts with default callbacks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated HiggsAudioTrainer (`trainer/train_v2_ddp.py`)

Fixed the `training_step` method signature to match the Hugging Face Trainer interface:
```python
def training_step(self, model, inputs, num_items_in_batch=None):
    # Call the parent training step to get loss and outputs
    loss, outputs = self.compute_loss(model, inputs, return_outputs=True)
    
    # Manually pass inputs/outputs to callbacks (without model to avoid conflicts)
    if self.callback_handler:
        callback_kwargs = {
            'inputs': inputs,
            'outputs': outputs
        }
        self.callback_handler.call_event("on_step_end", self.args, self.state, self.control, **callback_kwargs)
    
    return loss
```

### 2. Updated Strategic Logging Callbacks (`callbacks/strategic_logging.py`)

Changed all callbacks from `on_log` to `on_step_end`:
- `InputLoggerCallback`
- `OutputLoggerCallback` 
- `SharedAttentionLoggerCallback`
- `ZeroShotVerificationLoggerCallback`

Updated method signatures to properly handle inputs and outputs without conflicting with default callbacks:
```python
def on_step_end(self, args, state, control, inputs=None, outputs=None, **kwargs):
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging

Added comprehensive debugging output at step 1 to show what data is being received by each callback.

## Expected Results

With this fix, the strategic logging should now work as intended:

1. **Step 1**: Detailed debugging information showing what data is received
2. **Every N steps**: Detailed analysis of model inputs, outputs, and performance
3. **Proper data access**: Audio features, logits, and other model data for zero-shot voice cloning verification

## Files Modified

- `trainer/train_v2_ddp.py` - Added `training_step` override with correct signature
- `callbacks/strategic_logging.py` - Changed callbacks to use `on_step_end` and avoid parameter conflicts
- Various validation scripts created for testing

## Validation

All components have been validated:
- ✅ Syntax validation passed for all files
- ✅ Callbacks now use `on_step_end` method
- ✅ Trainer properly overrides `training_step` with correct signature
- ✅ No parameter conflicts with default callbacks
- ✅ Required parameters are present in callback methods
- ✅ Integration test passed successfully

This fix should resolve the "NOT FOUND" issues and the TypeErrors, providing the detailed strategic logging needed for debugging zero-shot voice cloning training.
