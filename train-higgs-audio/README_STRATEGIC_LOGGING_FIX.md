# Strategic Logging Fix for Zero-Shot Voice Cloning

## Problem Summary

The strategic logging callbacks were not receiving the model inputs and outputs needed to provide detailed analysis of the training process. This resulted in logs showing "Logits: NOT FOUND", "Whisper Embedding Status: ❌ DISABLED or NOT FOUND", and "Input IDs: ❌ NOT FOUND".

## Root Cause

The issue was a fundamental misunderstanding of how Hugging Face Trainer callbacks work:

1. **Wrong Callback Method**: The callbacks were using `on_log` which is primarily for logging metrics, not for accessing model data
2. **No Data Passing**: Hugging Face Trainer does not automatically pass model inputs and outputs to callbacks
3. **Missing Override**: The trainer was not overridden to manually pass this data to the callbacks

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated HiggsAudioTrainer (`trainer/train_v2_ddp.py`)

Added a custom `training_step` method that:
```python
def training_step(self, model, inputs):
    # Call the parent training step to get loss and outputs
    loss, outputs = self.compute_loss(model, inputs, return_outputs=True)
    
    # Manually pass inputs/outputs to callbacks
    if self.callback_handler:
        callback_kwargs = {
            'inputs': inputs,
            'outputs': outputs,
            'model': model
        }
        self.callback_handler.call_event("on_step_end", self.args, self.state, self.control, **callback_kwargs)
    
    return loss
```

### 2. Updated Strategic Logging Callbacks (`callbacks/strategic_logging.py`)

Changed all callbacks from `on_log` to `on_step_end`:
- `InputLoggerCallback`
- `OutputLoggerCallback` 
- `SharedAttentionLoggerCallback`
- `ZeroShotVerificationLoggerCallback`

Updated method signatures to properly handle:
```python
def on_step_end(self, args, state, control, inputs=None, outputs=None, model=None, **kwargs):
```

### 3. Enhanced Debugging

Added comprehensive debugging output at step 1 to show what data is being received by each callback.

## Expected Results

With this fix, the strategic logging should now work as intended:

1. **Step 1**: Detailed debugging information showing what data is received
2. **Every N steps**: Detailed analysis of model inputs, outputs, and performance
3. **Proper data access**: Audio features, logits, and other model data for zero-shot voice cloning verification

## Files Modified

- `trainer/train_v2_ddp.py` - Added `training_step` override
- `callbacks/strategic_logging.py` - Changed callbacks to use `on_step_end`
- Various validation scripts created for testing

## Validation

All components have been validated:
- ✅ Syntax validation passed for all files
- ✅ Callbacks now use `on_step_end` method
- ✅ Trainer properly overrides `training_step`
- ✅ Required parameters are present in callback methods
- ✅ Integration test passed successfully

This fix should resolve the "NOT FOUND" issues and provide the detailed strategic logging needed for debugging zero-shot voice cloning training.
